- 👋 Hi, I’m @abshifflett
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, always something new. I've been more on in the realm of physical technology (mechanical, chemical, etc.) for years now and playing around with a variety of tech but not digging. I work in Pharma currently, coach youth sports, and spend lots of time with my family and two GSDs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JAVA, SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at this time, I'm not sure I can be much help!
- 📫 How to reach me ... yet to be determined.
